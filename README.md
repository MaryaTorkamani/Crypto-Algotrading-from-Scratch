# Crypto-Data-Analysis
Crypto Data Analysis
we want share our knowledge in crypto + data
The Goal: Complementary data analysis in cryptocurrency historical data in order to get insight for our next Algotrading project.

First of all we need a roadmap for this project to know where to begin our journey and what steps are ahead of us.
Below you can find a simplified roadmap for starting out data analysis.

At the first step, we need to capture our data from different sources. There are several methods for doing so, but we are using yfinance library in python. Now it is time to select our coins to analyze. We got to select them not only based on their market cap, but also consider different aspect of them, e.g Utility and correlation with BTC.
My chosen token and coins (Pair with USDT) for comparison are: BTC, ETH, XMR, MANA, BNB, XRP
My selection approach is based on the categories existed in cryptocurrency area. Also, I want to test this hypothesis that correlation of tokens with BTC decreases over time depending on their categories.
